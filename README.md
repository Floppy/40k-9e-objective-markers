# Objective Markers for Warhammer 40k 9th edition

Faction-specific printable objective markers for Warhammer 40,000 9th edition.

The markers are 192mm in diameter; this is the size of a 40mm marker (the inner ring, where visible) plus 3" around it. That means that if you're touching the large ring, you're in range of the objective.

## Files

Included in this repo are SVG source files and 3d printable STL files for various faction objectives:

* T'au
* Tyranids
*  ... and maybe more to come if [requested](https://github.com/Floppy/40k-9e-objective-markers/issues/new)

## 3D Printing

To 3D print the STL versions, I recommend using an FDM printer with 0.2mm layer height - the STLs are 0.6mm high, so this will give you 3 layers. I also recommend using a concentric pattern for top and bottom infill, it gives a nice appearance; but of course you can choose whatever you like.

## SVG to STL workflow

If you modify anything, to turn the SVG designs into STLs:

1. Load the SVG into Inkscape
1. Pop all the elements out of any groups they're in
1. Select the circles, and use `Path/Stroke to Path`
1. Select everything else, and use `Path/Object to Path`
1. Save as a temporary file somewhere
1. Importa the path SVG into a model in [TinkerCAD](https://tinkercad.com)
1. Set height to 0.6mm
1. Export as STL
